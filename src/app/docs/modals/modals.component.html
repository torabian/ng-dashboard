<h1>Modals and pickers in ng-dashboard</h1>

<p>
  In ng-dashboard team, we provide some modals and pickers for the projects
  built with this framework. We are sick of broken pickers, who do not work on
  mobile, having accessibilty issues, and so on. Therefor, we build most of them
  from scratch in order to fit specific application rather than a general
  datepicker or timepicker solution.
</p>

<!-- Basic confirmation modal-->
<h2>(1/3) Confirm modal</h2>

<p>
  We provide you a minimal modal service, to show a text and for confirmation.
</p>

<pre><code [highlight]="sampleModal | json"></code></pre>

<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="showDialog()">
  Open confirmation modal
</button>

<div class="chessboard-view">
  <ngd-base-modal type="INLINE" [modal]="sampleModal"></ngd-base-modal>
</div>

<!-- Yes/No confirmation modal -->
<h2>(2/3) Yes/No dialog</h2>
<p>
  You can change the buttons to include use and no.
</p>

<pre><code [highlight]="sampleModalYes | json"></code></pre>

<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="showDialogYes()">
  Open Modal Yes/No
</button>

<div class="chessboard-view">

</div>

<!-- Day picker modal -->
<h2>(3/3) Date (day) picker</h2>
<p>
  Use day picker for forms that need to select an specific day of the month.
  <strong
    >This is not a replacement for date picker, which selects specific date, or
    a range of dates</strong
  >
